      <h1>Breadcrumbs</h1>

      <p><strong>Breadcrumbs show users where they are in a website's structure and how to get all the way back to the homepage.</strong></p>

      <h3>code example</h3>

      <h2>When to use breadcrumbs</h2>
      <p>Breadcrumbs should be used on every content page, such as a health information page.</p>
      <p>This helps users understand where they are in the website's hierarchical structure and how to back through related content.</p>

      <h2>How to use breadcrumbs</h2>
      <p>Breadcrumbs should be placed at the top of a content page, below the header navigation and above the H1 of the page.</p>
      <p>They should show the hierarchy of content pages starting at the homepage and ending at the parent of the page the user is on.  For example, on the Chickenpox page, the breadcrumb will read:</p>
      <p>Home > Health A to Z</p>
      <p>and then the H1 of the page would read: Chickenpox</p>
      <p>Breadcrumbs should not include a link to the page a user is currently on, the H1 of the page is there to let users know they're in the right place.</p>
      <h3>Breadcrumbs on mobile screens</h3>
      <p>On a mobile screen size, the breadcrumb will just show the parent page, with a back arrow, like this:</p>
      <p> < Health A to Z</p>
      <p>The breadcrumbs should be styled consistently with the rest of the hyperlinks on site, so for NHS.UK we use blue link text, with a blue underline.</p>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Breadcrumbs should not include a link to the page a user is currently on. In research, users with screen readers have found long breadcrumb tails and long H1s problematic when read out together.</p>
     
      <h2>Benefits of breadcrumbs</h2>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>During testing, NHS.UK's Information Architecture team found users were confident using breadcrumbs, and often used them to go up a level and explore what other content was available.</p>
